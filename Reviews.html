  <h2>Game Reviews</h2>
  <p>When I play games, I don’t just focus on winning — I pay attention to the story, graphics, gameplay, and how fun it feels overall. 
  I believe every game has something special to offer, whether it’s the teamwork in <strong>CODM</strong>,<strong>PUBG</strong>,<strong>BLOODSTIKE</strong>,<strong>VALORANT</strong> the strategy is to wait and be patient.
  The strategy in playing adventure gmes is to read and watch the cutscenes and try to analyze the games mechanics in <strong>GENSHIN IMPACT</strong>,<strong>HONKAI IMPACT</strong>,<strong>BLUE ARCHIVE</strong>,<strong>MLBB</strong> in this games you need to play it happy
  The other games I play is <strong>ROBLOX</strong>,<strong>LEFT 4 DEAD</strong>,<strong>GTA</strong> the way I play this is to play with friends and to every strategy in this game to have fun and not just win.
  This last game is my favorite since I was 12 years old,<strong>AMONG US</strong>  my strategy here is to manipulate other players and make I play it safe when I'm the Imposter in this game.
